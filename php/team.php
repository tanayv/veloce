He's made it this far, so he sees no reason to stop now. Alan Papalia, ladies and gentlemen. Majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Minoring in Computer Science.

His main goals for this year are to design and implement a custom data logger, achieve active aerodynamics for the rear wing, and to beat Missouri S&T. Outside of school, Jacob enjoys reading, playing golf, and skiing. After graduation, he plans to pursue a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering and stay in school forever, preferably somewhere with mountains.
